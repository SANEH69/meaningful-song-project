            <h2> To my younger self lyrics highlights</h2>
            <p>To my younger self, I'm writing you from 2012.
                It's not high school that is killing me, it's my mental health.
                Know you struggle now but brace yourself for these few years of hell.
                You'll paint a smile every day but every night, you'll pray for help.
                <br>
                Wish there was something that I could do to save you from what's coming.
                You might be a soldier, but know that your demons built an army.
                And they're taking over now, all I see through my tears is black.
                Tell mom and dad I love them, but I have to go, no turning back.
                <br>
                And I know that your heart is aching.
                I know that you don't know why.
                And you can't stop your hands from shaking.
                Now you want to die.
                <br>
                If I could tell you everything I know now.
                I'd tell you that the darkness always fades out.
                In the end, the light will emerge with no doubt.
                You just gotta keep going, baby, don't back down.
            </p>
